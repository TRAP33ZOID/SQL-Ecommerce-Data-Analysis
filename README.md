# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
*understanding the process of loading data files into pg admin
*cleaning data sets
*extracting insights from data using SQL queries



## Process
1)intial examination of the data and choosing prelimnary data types for each column heading
2)importing the data to pg admin
3)cleaning the data. for example, deleting columns that are 100% empty. unifying place holder variables (not set, not available)
4)analyzing the data and using SQL to extract answers.
5)creating our own questions
6)exploring risk areas for quality assurance



## Results
countries with highest revenues (USA), average products ordered (LED light pen 456), product category preferences (YouTube | Shop by Brand | Google Merchandise Store).

## Challenges 
-Technical issues:Realised the hard way not to run entire database with big entries because it breaks pg admin
-Dealing with data inconsistencies and wrong data types (ID with letters).
-Time management because I was catching up on material


## Future Goals
Explore visualization tools.
